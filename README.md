# Space-Buds

### This repository details the submission of the Space Buds team for NASA's 2021 International Space Apps Hackathon. Space Buds has selected to answer the problem "Let It Go (Without A Bang)". The team implemented a mechanical device that detaches two spaceship modules without the use of pyrotechnics. The design has two aspects: the physical 3D modelling of the device, including the shrouds, internal motor, gearbox, rod, and spring, and the hardware implementation of a custom PCB to drive the selected motor.
